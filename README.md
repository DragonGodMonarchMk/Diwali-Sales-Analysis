# Diwali-Sales-Analysis
Diwali Sales Analysis ‚Äì Developed an end‚Äëto‚Äëend Exploratory Data Analytics pipeline using Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze a curated Diwali-period dataset collected from a small town. Conducted comprehensive exploratory analysis on sales, customer demographics (age‚Äëgroup, gender, marital status, occupation, state), and product categories. Generated actionable insights to identify high‚Äêvalue customer segments and best‚Äëselling product lines. Published a clean, well‚Äëcommented Jupyter Notebook (available in Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis.zip) on GitHub, demonstrating reproducibility and data storytelling from raw CSV through insight generation.

*Analysis of Diwali purchase behavior for a small-town community.*  
This repository includes a Jupyter notebook (packaged as `Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis.zip`) containing clean, step-by-step exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, and insights tailored for a local Diwali shopping dataset. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## üîç Project Overview

Diwali, the festival of lights, represents one of the largest cultural and commercial events in India. This project investigates local shopping trends from a small-town dataset, uncovering purchase behavior patterns, customer segmentation, and top-performing product categories.

The analysis combines:
- Demographic profiling (gender, age group, marital status, occupation, location)  
- Sales trends by product category  
- Storytelling-ready data visualizations using bar charts, pie charts, and time-series plots

## üìä Dataset & Scope

- **Data origin**: Local CSV file with a few thousand sales records from the Diwali season in a small town (crowdsourced from community registries).  
- **Key columns** commonly include: `Customer_ID`, `Gender`, `Age_Group`, `Marital_Status`, `State`, `Occupation`, `Product_Category`, `Order_Quantity`, `Sales_Amount`, `Date_of_Purchase`

*Note: Fields and record counts may vary; please replace examples with version found in your folder.* :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analysis Methodology

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Data Loading & Cleaning** | Imported CSV using pandas, handled missing/null values, converted date fields, and standardized categorical labels. |
| **Customer Segment Profiling** | Explored demographics to identify high-buying segments (e.g., females age 26‚Äì35, married, employed in healthcare or IT/aviation). |
| **Product & Sales Analysis** | Ranked product categories and SKUs by total orders and sales. Bar charts show Food, Clothing, and Electronics typically dominating sales. |
| **Time & Location Trends** | Aggregated by date/time and state to highlight peak sales windows and regional hotspots. |
| **Visualization** | Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for coherent visuals including bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and annotated tables. |
| **Reporting** | Translated observations into actionable business takeaways aimed at local store inventory, staffing, and promotion plans. |

## üß† Key Insights *(Example findings)*

- **Demographic insight**: Male shoppers form the majority, but *female shoppers aged 26-35* typically contribute more to total spend. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- **Product preferences**: Top three SKUs‚Äî*food items, apparel, and electronics* account for over 60 % of transactions. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **Geographical pattern**: Highest number of orders came from local districts ‚Äî *Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh* (estimated) ‚Äî with clear LED & snack sales spikes during early‚Äêevening hours. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

*(Customize these after reviewing your notebook outputs.)*
